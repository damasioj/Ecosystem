# Master's Thesis: Ecosystem Simulation

This project is being developed for a Master's thesis that studies the implementation of behaviours in subjects using Machine Learning. This scenario is a combination of all other scenarios related to the thesis (Animal, collector and hauler) and attempts to integrate all of the agents into a single environment.

This project focuses on introducing game design aspects to the code structure that might be expected in real video games. 

# Unity ML-Agents SDK

The project uses Unity ML-Agents to train agents.

# Goals

The following are the goals of this project:

- [ ] Integrate agents into environment without requiring retraining
	- [x] Resource Collector Agent
	- [ ] Animal Agent
	- [ ] Hauler Agent
- [ ] Adding new objects to the environments (i.e. targets) and having agents interact with them as required

# Requirements

To run this environment, you will need:
- Python 3.6.1 or greater
	- mlagents version 0.16.1
- Unity 2019.2.0f1 or greater
